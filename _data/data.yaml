[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_yet_it_moves[+]“E pur si muove”]] (And yet it moves) -Galileo in 1633, after being forced by the Catholic Church to recant his claims that the earth moves around the sun. His powerful and profound statement was a reminder for all time that it doesn’t matter what doctrine or dogma you adhere to nor does it matter what you want to believe or compel others to declare. Facts and reality do not require your belief and the universe is as it is, regardless of what you’d like it to be.</span><span class='text'>2. [[https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/6772ff56-2fc3-4125-8d59-f115533708f1/gif[+]“Make me a liar, Fish.”]] -Jodi Foster in <em>Contact</em> expressing an essential tenet of science: falsifiability. It is only after a theory has withstood robust criticism, rigorous testing, and peer review analysis that one should accept it. Therefore a true scientist welcomes push-back and encourages even their most cherished ideas to be subjected to thorough critical scrutiny. In a sense, they should want to be proven wrong, because that is the purest way to pursue truth."

She used to be in the amazing all-female Greenpoint illustrators collective, [[https://pizzaisland.wordpress.com/[+]Pizza Island]] (which also included the incredible [[http://www.juliawertz.com/[+]Julia Wertz]]). After serving as production designer on BoJack Horseman, Hanawalt’s new show [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZybYIJtbcu0[+]Tuca & Bertie]] is so much fun. I think it’s best appreciated after having listened to [[https://www.npr.org/2015/03/24/393853692/for-bojack-horseman-it-matters-if-a-cartoon-dog-is-a-man-or-a-woman[+]this NPR interview]] and reading [[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/arts/television/tuca-and-bertie-bojack-horseman-netflix.html[+]this profile]].

And bonus, Hanawalt’s long-term partner is Adam Conover, of [[https://www.trutv.com/shows/adam-ruins-everything/index.html[+]Adam Ruins Everything]] of whom I’m also a huge fan. UPDATE: when Tuca & Bertie was canceled by Netflix after one perfect season, Hanawalt’s collaborator Raphael Bob-Waksberg tweeted [[https://twitter.com/RaphaelBW/status/1154633034513055744?s=20[+]this poignant thread]]."

Maria is aware of her unexpected reaction to this opportunity and is trying to understand why. She’s not exactly confident that she will be able to easily handle this obstacle before her. Instead, she has confidence “in confidence alone.” That is, in her potential to rise to any occasion. She trusts not in her current skills but in her ability to learn and adapt to whatever challenges present themselves, knowing full well that she doesn’t really know what they will be. She is absolutely afraid and self-doubting and yet resolves to do it <em>anyway</em>. Through self talk and body language she is in fact trying to convince <em>herself</em> that she’s confident, exemplifying the Aristotelian insight that behavior leads to character, not the other way around. Brava, Julie Andrews."

It allows you to make a binary choice by way of a laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland which uses a Quantis brand quantum device called a beam splitter to send a single photon into a partially-silvered mirror and return one of your given options based on how the photon is detected. Since this constitutes observing a quantum event, the many-worlds interpretation of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle in quantum mechanics implies that you’ve just split the wave function of the entire universe into two branches, creating two parallel quantum states and this app simply tells you which universe you are in. You can then assume there’s another version of you in another universe who got the other option returned to them and you’re now on separate paths. The app even keeps a tree diagram of all your past decisions and the various forks you took to where you are today."

While he does adjust accordingly to feedback, he doesn’t take it personally and stays focused on his goal. And in the end, after much failure, he succeeds.
